# Lego-Project-Solidworks
This was a project done in Solidworks for an engineering class 

The project was to create a lego model shown below. This was done by creaing each individual part after they have been measured using a caliper. Below are images of the numerous parts listed and uploaded to github are all of the parts made as well as the drawings made to track dimensions of the parts.
